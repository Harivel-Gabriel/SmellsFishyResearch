# SmellsFishyResearch

This directory will help the SmellsFishy crew implementing AI in the project. This directory will be updated with ressources and ideas about algorithm, methods and other way to use AI, for the improvement of secret's detection.

## Potential objectives

- The AI could recognize what type of secret has been detected (password, API, email address, URL...)
- The AI could sort the detected secrets by probabilty of efficiency. The more likely a secret is working, the higher it will be in the list of detected secret
- The AI could show a confidence score for each secrets.

## Methods

- Using databases ?
- Arbre de d√©cision ?
- bigramme ?
